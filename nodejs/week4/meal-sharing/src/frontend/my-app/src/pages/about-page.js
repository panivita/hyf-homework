            {"    "}Hi there and welcome to <b>Homemade cakes</b>, a page where you’ll
            find beautiful European Cakes and Desserts as well as other savory
            dishes my Ukrainian family enjoys.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve been cooking since 10 and consistently for the past 12 years.
            Creating things from scratch is my passion, be it an elaborate
            dessert that requires time and patience or a simple one-pan dish.
          </p>
          <p>
            5 years ago I decided to make my hobby into my business and I am
            still enjoying every minute. My speciality is a wide range of
            delicious cupcakes flavour combinations, European cakes and
            desserts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cakes help me trigger happy memories of special days, let me help
            you make your own happy memories by me creating the perfect cake for
            you. I custom designed bespoke cakes for any occasion large or
            small. From birthday cakes, christening, baby showers to just
            something simple but stunning for a special family tea, cupcakes,
            and cookies all home made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every cake I create leaves my kitchen with a little bit of love
            given by me. Quality of the cakes and bakes is a top priority, I use
            locally sourced, free range and fair trade produce where I can, to
            create delicious hand crafted cakes.
